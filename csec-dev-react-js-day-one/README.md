# Pricing Cards

## Description

This project is a simple example of pricing cards using ReactJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The project was created to practice the use of TailwindCSS, TypeScript and React to create a simple example of a pricing card.

The `PricingCard` component is a simple component that receives a `planName`, `pricePerMonth`, `storage`, `features` as props and renders a card with the information.

Typescript was used to define the types of the props to make it less prone to errors.

TailwindCSS was used to style the components and make them responsive.
